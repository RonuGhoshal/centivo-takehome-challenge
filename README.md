## Centivo Takehome Challenge

- Created [/users/:id](https://github.com/RonuGhoshal/centivo-takehome-challenge/blob/main/server.js#L11) endpoint

- Handled success response (200)

- Handled the case of the user being under 21 with an error message (400)

- Handled Object Id errors (400)

I added a few users to the database manually, then tested out a few requests to the endpoint:
